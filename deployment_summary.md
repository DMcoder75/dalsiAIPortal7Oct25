# Dalsi AI Portal Deployment Summary

## ✅ Deployment Status: SUCCESSFUL

**Firebase Hosting URL:** https://innate-temple-337717.web.app

## ✅ Layout Issue Resolution: FIXED

### Problem Identified
The revenue model section was displaying pricing cards in a vertical mobile layout on desktop screens, causing poor user experience and excessive scrolling.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Updated responsive grid classes**: Changed from `grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3` to `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3`
2. **Enhanced card layout**: Added `h-full flex flex-col` to ensure equal card heights
3. **Improved content distribution**: Restructured CardContent with proper flex layout for better spacing
4. **Fixed scaling behavior**: Modified scaling to only apply on medium+ screens (`md:scale-105`)

### Technical Changes Made
- **File Modified**: `/src/components/PricingSection.jsx`
- **Grid Layout**: Now properly responsive across all breakpoints
- **Card Structure**: Improved flex layout for consistent card heights
- **Content Organization**: Better spacing and alignment within cards

### Verification Results
✅ **Desktop Layout**: Cards now display horizontally side-by-side on desktop screens
✅ **Tablet Layout**: Cards display in 2-column layout on medium screens  
✅ **Mobile Layout**: Cards stack vertically on small screens (as intended)
✅ **Equal Heights**: All pricing cards maintain consistent heights
✅ **Responsive Behavior**: Smooth transitions between breakpoints
