```

### Logged-in User Flow:
```
1. User logs in
2. Has 3 more free messages (total 4 including guest message)
3. Sends messages 2-4 → Success (count saved to database)
4. Tries 5th message → Blocked with "Unlock Unlimited Access" banner
5. Clicks "Upgrade Now" → Navigates to pricing page
```

### Subscribed User Flow:

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### localStorage Structure:
```javascript
{
  "dalsi_guest_messages": "1" // Number of messages sent as guest
}
```

### Database Tracking:
- Count messages in `messages` table where `sender = 'user'`
- Filter by `user_id` from `chats` table
- Real-time count updates after each message

### Usage Status Object:
```javascript
{
  isGuest: boolean,
  used: number,
  limit: number,
  remaining: number,
  needsLogin: boolean,
  needsSubscription: boolean,
  subscriptionType?: string
}
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **dalsiAPI streaming** - Currently using placeholder implementation
   - Need to integrate with actual Dalsi AI API
   - Streaming may not work until API is configured

2. **Image upload** - Requires DalSi AI-Vi subscription
   - Feature exists but needs API integration

3. **Chat persistence** - Messages save to DB but sidebar doesn't show history yet
   - Need to implement chat list UI

---

## 📝 Notes

- Guest tracking uses localStorage, so clearing browser data resets the count
- Logged-in user tracking is permanent in database
- Usage count only applies to "dalsi-ai" model, not other models
- Subscription status is checked from `user_subscriptions` table

**Implementation Status:** Phase 1 Complete ✅  
**Next Phase:** Chat history UI improvements  
**Priority:** High
