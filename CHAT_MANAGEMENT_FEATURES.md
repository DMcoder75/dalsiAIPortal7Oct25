## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. **Auto-Create Chat on First Message** ✅

**How it works:**
- When a logged-in user sends their first message without an active chat
- System automatically creates a new chat
- Chat title is auto-generated from the first 5 words of the message
- If title exceeds 40 characters, it's truncated with "..."
- Chat appears immediately in the left sidebar below "New Chat" button

**Example:**
```
User types: "What is artificial intelligence and how does it work?"
Auto-generated title: "What is artificial intelligence and..."
```

**Code Location:** `EnhancedChatInterface.jsx` lines 709-734

---

### 2. **Message Limit Per Chat (11 Messages)** ✅

**How it works:**
- Each chat can contain a maximum of 11 messages
- This includes both user messages and AI responses
- When limit is reached, user sees an alert
- Alert message: "This chat has reached the maximum of 11 messages. Please start a new chat to continue."
- Input is blocked until user clicks "New Chat"

**Message Count:**
- User message 1 + AI response 1 = 2 messages
- User message 2 + AI response 2 = 4 messages
- ...
- User message 6 + AI response 6 = 12 messages (BLOCKED at 11)

**Code Location:** `EnhancedChatInterface.jsx` lines 709-713

---

### 3. **Chat Options Menu (Three Dots)** ✅

**How it works:**
- Each chat in the sidebar has a three-dot menu (MoreVertical icon)
- Menu appears on hover
- Clicking the three dots opens a dropdown menu

**Menu Options:**

#### a) **Rename Chat**
- Opens a modal dialog
- User can enter a new title
- Press Enter or click "Rename" to save
- Press Escape or click "Cancel" to abort
- Updates immediately in sidebar

#### b) **Archive Chat**
- Moves chat to "Archives" section
- Chat disappears from main chat list
- If current chat is archived, it's deselected
- Archives section appears at bottom of sidebar

#### c) **Delete Chat**
- Opens confirmation dialog
- Warning: "This will permanently delete this chat and all its messages. This action cannot be undone."
- User must confirm deletion
- Deletes chat AND all associated messages from database
- If current chat is deleted, user returns to welcome screen

**Code Location:** 
- Component: `ChatOptionsMenu.jsx`
- Integration: `EnhancedChatInterface.jsx` lines 956-962, 998-1005

---

### 4. **Archives Section** ✅

**How it works:**
- Appears at bottom of sidebar when there are archived chats
- Shows count: "Archives (3)"
- Click to expand/collapse (with animated chevron icon)
- Archived chats are listed with same UI as active chats
- Each archived chat has its own three-dot menu

**Archive Menu Options:**
- **Unarchive**: Moves chat back to main list
- **Rename**: Same as active chats
- **Delete**: Same as active chats (with confirmation)

**Code Location:** `EnhancedChatInterface.jsx` lines 967-1012
